# Frontend Customization

## Simple Customizations

Use this method if you only want to override or insert images, fonts or other static assets.
Create a "webapp" folder inside src/main. This represents the root folder of the webapp.

To insert/override: 
- images: put your images under assets/images inside the webapp folder.
- fonts: put your fonts under assets/fonts inside the webapp folder.

## To Customize Typescript, HTML or SCSS

You have to add your angular code under src/main/ng/src.
Also place the assets into src/main/ng/src/assets folder.

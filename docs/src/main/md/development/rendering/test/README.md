# Test

- First of all you have to [build](../build/README.md) local docker images.

- Start up a test-instance using local docker images with build-in artifacts by calling:

  ```
  ./rendering/deploy.sh test 
  ```       
  > If necessary, some [customization](../../../common/README.md#customization) can be made.

# Download

- If you just want to try it out, then: 

  * download the docker artifacts directly from our artifacts repository: 

    - for all official releases from our
      [release repository](https://artifacts.edu-sharing.com/#browse/browse:community-releases:org%2Fedu_sharing%2Fedu_sharing-community-docker-deploy)
    
    - for all development snapshots from our
      [snapshot repository](https://artifacts.edu-sharing.com/#browse/browse:community-snapshots:org%2Fedu_sharing%2Fedu_sharing-community-docker-deploy).

    > Drill down to select your preferred version and then
      drill down again to select your preferred archive format (`bin.zip`, `bin.tar.gz`).
   
  * unpack the downloaded docker artifact in a directory on your local environment.

    > In the documentation chapters we call this directory as "root directory of this project".
